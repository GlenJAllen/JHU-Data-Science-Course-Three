# JHU-Data-Science-Course-Three

This repo contains a single script, run_analysis.R, which merges test and train datasets, renames columns, extracts only the relevant columns, maps activity codes to human-readable labels and then calculates the mean for each feature for each subject-activity combination.

See the codebook for information about the variables.

See the inline comments for greater detail about how the code works.
